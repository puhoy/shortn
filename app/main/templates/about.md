shortn is a small link shortening service i've written as part of a bigger project (take a look at [dojo](http://doj.ooo/)).
when its more or less done, i will release the code on [github](https://github.com/puhoy).

a part of the mechanic (that means the part that converts the database id to code (and backwards)) is stolen from [github.com/jessex/shrtn/](https://github.com/jessex/shrtn/), so... thank you, jessex
